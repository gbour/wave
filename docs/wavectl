- communicate via MQTT
- use a dedicated topic /adm/wavetcl/{id}
  response sent by server in /adm/wavectl/{id}/resp

- payload = json, msgpack later
- strong auth (TLS, scrypted password)

- dedicated topic for devices connections
	/adm/device/{id}/connected
	/adm/device/{id}/disconnected

	=> wavectl manager can announce available commands
	   emit({'/adm/device/{id}/connected', <<"deviceid">>}, undefined)
